                    You should consult your service manual for the period specified by your car’s manufacturer, as vehicles differ when it comes to servicing intervals. Of course, regular servicing will extend the life of your vehicle and regular servicing will protect the resale value of your car so we recommend that you have your vehicle serviced in line with the manufacturer’s recommendations.

                   <p> It certainly is. We’re confident enough to state that all mechanical repairs are guaranteed for a minimum of 12 months or 12000 miles.</p>

                      Yes, subject to availability, we can provide you with a fully insured courtesy car, but we do recommend you notify us of your need for a courtesy car at the time of booking.

                      Remember though that we also offer a free collection and delivery facility for customers based in Huntingdon. Please note this is a free collection / delivery for customer’s car only. Courtesy cars are only available for collection / drop-off at Romans Garage Services.

                        Servicing costs vary from vehicle to vehicle due to the varying cost of oils and parts. However, you can rest assured that our prices will be competitive and up to 50% cheaper than if you were to use a main dealer
