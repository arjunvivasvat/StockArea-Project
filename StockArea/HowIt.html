    <h3 style="text-align: center"> We start things off with a chat</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center">We meet and talk about your business, what resources you have in-house, how you engage with customers, what are your key services and what are your chosen customer catchment areas. Are there areas in the business you really want to push and equally areas where your rivals for the time being have stolen a march.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center"> Proposal & Walkthrough</h3>
      <p style="text-align: center">Once we’ve established your needs, we draw up a Proposal detailing what you get and our commitments to you all laid out in black and white. After that’s agreed we get to work designing a mock-up for you to approve and working on the content with you in ways that do not intrude on your busy days.</p>

If we need to try again, we will. This is a flexible stage to ensure we hit the sweet spot.</p>

We can work with the bare minimum from you using our proven methods and develop any in-put to make it SEO optimised. We also undertake an audit of your current website and migrate relevant content to your new one with us.</p>
